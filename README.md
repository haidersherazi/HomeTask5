# Home Task 05 - UNIT TESTING

## Team Details and Roles in HomeTask5 (Team # 4): 

### Tazeen Zahra Kazmi (Enrolment/Student No: 7219531)
	She has implemented the test cases which focus on the foundational aspects of the system, including metadata, log file handling, main functionality, and weather simulation.
 
### Syed Muhammad Haider Ali Sherazi (Enrolment/Student No: 7219530)
	He has defined the test cases including charging in different weather conditions and handling failures during the charging process. 

### Muhammad Tallal Bin Shahid (Enrolment/Student No: 7219428)
	He has defined the test cases including charging in different weather conditions and handling failures during the charging process. Also, he has integrated the coverage part and made sure that the code coverage is up to the market level.

### Hamid Zaib (Enrolment/Student No: 7219189)
	He has implemented test cases that primarily cover charging capabilities in specific weather conditions, station occupancy, and release-replenish interactions.

## Environment:

## Task Details:

### Java unit testing:

1. {assertNotNull} function to verify that an object reference is not null. It verifies if a specific value or object is present and has been initialized correctly in a test case.

2. {assertEquals}: This function checks if two objects or values are equal. Comparing the expected and actual results of a test case is a popular usage for it.

3. {assertFalse} method to determine whether a given boolean condition is false. It is employed when you anticipate that a specific condition will not hold true for the test case to succeed.

4. {assertTrue}: This function verifies the truth of a provided boolean condition. It's employed when you need a specific condition to hold in order for the test case to succeed.

5. {assertDoesNotThrow}:  This function is intended to declare that a specific code block doesn't raise any errors. It is especially helpful for testing code segments or functions that should function without raising exceptions.
